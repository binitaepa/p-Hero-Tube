        1. var, let and const are all used to declare variables in
        JavaScript.Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the
        immediate function body.Variables declared with the var keyword are
        hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be accessed in their
        enclosing scope even before they are declared. Variables declared with
        the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have
        scope to the immediate enclosing block.People should not use var much.

        2. Undefined is returned when you try to access a property or a method
        of an object that does not exist, while null is explicitly assigned to
        indicate the intentional absence of a value.

        3. There are numerous types of APIs, making it difficult for new
        developers to differentiate between each kind. In particular,
        Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architectural style
        that developers apply to web APIs. REST APIs provide simple, uniform
        interfaces because they can be used to make data, content, algorithms,
        media, and other digital resources available through web URLs.
        Essentially, REST APIs are the most common APIs used across the web
        today.
